This code needs the third party library JFreeChart (jfreechart-1.0.19).
Please first download it from here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/jfreechart/files/
Add the two files to your java IDE: jcommon-1.0.23.jar, jfreechart-1.0.19.jar

Another third party library is still needed: http://java.freehep.org/vectorgraphics/
And enjoy the codes^^
